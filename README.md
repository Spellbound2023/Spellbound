## Getting Started

### Setup the repository for development
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` from the root directory of the repository to install all the dependencies.

### Get started with development
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
